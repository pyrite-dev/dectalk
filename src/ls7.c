 *
 *    Functionality:
 * Fancy dictionary search.
 * Needs to look in both the user and the
 * builtin dictionaries. Understands a limited bit of
 * affix stripping, so that simple plurals and things
 * work with dictionary entries.
 *
 ***********************************************************************
 *    Revision History:
 * 01 05-Apr-85	DGC	Changed some [|] to [x] as per DHK.
 * 02 08-Apr-85 DGC	Changed the third argument to the
 *			lookup routines to conditionally block
 *			the output of ")" and "(".
 * 03 16-Apr-85 DGC	Changes for Tony. Add "-able" (2 pass).
 *			Add "-ness", "-ize" (dumb).
 * 04 10-May-85 DGC	Undid 01, sounded bad.
 * 05 15-May-85 DGC	Fixed insertion of [|] in plurals.
 *			Didn't insert [|] in words like "references".
 * 06 17-May-85 DGC	"TT" is a pair more often than it is not.
 *			Removed it from the blocking list in the pair
 *			deletion routine.
 * 07 18-May-85 DGC	Added "-ings", which works just like "-ing"
 *			except for the added [z]. Added "-ers", which
 *			is just like "-er" except for the added [z].
 *			These are conditional, in case Tony and/or
 *			Dennis change their minds.
 * 08 24-May-85 DGC	Changed "lastlook" to the more general "lphone".
 *			Look in "ls1.c" for the reason.
 * 09 05-Jun-85 DGC	Change 05 was not done quite right; Dennis
 *			and I didn't understand one another.
 * 10 27-Jun-85 DGC	Made "-ers" work right.
 * 11 18-Jul-85 DGC	Added some conditional code to make the
 *			"ss-es" and "sh-es" work the way that Tony
 *			thinks it should work.
 * 12 12-Aug-85 DGC	"ment" used to be [m|nt], changed to [mxnt]
 *			to be the same as the dictionary.
 * 13 18-Sep-85 DGC	Stylistic changes, suggested by "lint".
 * ----------------	First 23 class release, voided out by Engineering.
 * 14 03-Dec-85 DGC	The two dictionary searches (blook, ulook)
 *			were in the wrong order. The user dictionary
 *			must be searched first. Thanks to WeatherBank.
 * ----------------	Released as C5005 V1.0 firmware.
 * 15 21-Oct-86 DGC	Changes for KRM.
 * 16 29-NOV-89 EAB	Changes for NKR-It's OK as is becuase NKR has a user dictionary.
