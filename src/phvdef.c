 *      Cur speaker def does not really change until loadspdef set to TRUE
 *
 *      Thus one can load a new speaker into curspdef[] at any time
 *      without ever really changing the output voice until PHCLAUSE()
 *      is called with a new input phonemic clause.

 *    Revision History:
 * 0001  6-Dec-84 DK    Adopted from DECtalk klvdef.c
 * 0002 27-Dec-84 DGC   Added the "readonly" things for the 80186.
 * 0003 14-Jan-85 DK    Fine tune voices to new tilt(f0) function
 * 0004 21-Jan-85 DK    Increase richness of Paul (less base, more like old Paul)
 * 0005 22-Apr-85 DK    Fix Betty to better match Diane Br.
 * 0006 30-Apr-85 DK    Overload calibration for 3.0 for all voices
 * 0007  3-Jun-85 DK    Increase SR for more lively voices
 * 0008 10-Jun-85 DK    Paul: ap down, Betty: ap up, Dennis: less breathy
 * 0009 20-Jun-85 DK    Betty: ap back down a bit
 * 0010 24-Jul-85 DK    Boost LO so don't have to shift R1c output
 * 0011 29-Jul-85 DK    Adjust spdef levels to avoid overloads during aspiration
 * 0012 26-Aug-85 DK    Ursula still overloads, back off gains
 * 0013 06-Sep-85 DGC   Harry head size to 115, from 120.
 * 0014 07-jan-91 EAB   re-evaluated and adjusted gains for all voices for 
 *                      DECtalk-PC release
 * 0015 03-may-93 eab   Changed betty's values to match 88 code except for new
 * 0016 19-Oct-93 WIH   Added definitions for 8 kHz. sample rate.
 * 0017 22-Mar-95 EAB   Merged VTM definitions from Alpha group.
 * 0018 16-JAN-96 SIK Removed white space inbetween # and include in places
 * 					  where #include is commented out. 
 * 0019 17-JUL-96 KB    The breathiness parameters for Wendy, Kit, Denise and Frank
 *						had been changed (decremented).  When this release shipped
 *						many customers complained.  The parameters were changed back
 *						so they are as breathy as they have always been.
