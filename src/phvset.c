 *    Creation Date:01-JAN-1985
 *
 *    Functionality:
 * This file contains functions
 * to select new speakers, to change individual
 * fields of a speaker definition, and to
 * convert the values from the format used by
 * the voice commands to the format used by
 * the signal processor. Based on the one for
 * the new synthesizer.
 *
 ***********************************************************************
 *    Revision History:
 * 0001 01-Jan-85 DK	Initial creation
 * 0002 02-Jan-85 DGC	The speaker def. code called "SP_AS" "2".
 *			Not a bug, just a tidy up.
 * 0003 19-Jan-85 DGC	The LIMIT structure def. is now in phdefs.h
 * 0004 19-Feb-85 DK	Send to chip only pars that are used
 * 0005 13-Jun-85 DK	Add Vax-only code to print spdefs for manual
 * 0006 18-Jun-85 DGC	"g5" => "lo".
 * 0007 18-Jul-85 DK	Rescale "SP_FT".
 * 0008 25-Jul-85 DK	Rescale spdeftltoff.
 * 0009 4-apr-96 EAB SP_BR has had a bug since day one it wanted to be
 *						sp_br**2 >>1 not <<1 so that 100(max) is close to
 *						4096(1 in frac arith) + sp_br**2 >>1 aprox max
 *						value of 8192.
 * 0010 23-apr-96 tek	remove spurious printf from 0009 (v26)
